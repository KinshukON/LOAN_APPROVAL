# Loan Approval System with Explainable AI

This repository contains two main components that work together to demonstrate Explainable AI (XAI) in a practical loan approval application:

## 1. loan_approval_project

This is the core ML/XAI project that supports the [Explainable AI Blog Series](https://datanizant.com/unlocking-ai-transparency-a-practical-guide-to-getting-started-with-explainable-ai-xai/). It implements:

- Machine Learning model for loan approval predictions
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) integration
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis
- Model bias detection and mitigation strategies

For detailed information about this component, please refer to the README in the `loan_approval_project` directory.

## 2. loan_approval_ui

This is the web application that provides a user interface for:

- Uploading and processing loan application data
- Viewing model predictions
- Exploring LIME and SHAP explanations
- Visualizing model performance and feature importance

For detailed information about the UI component, including setup and usage instructions, please refer to the README in the `loan_approval_ui` directory.

## Blog Series

This project is part of a comprehensive blog series on Explainable AI. Follow along with the series:

1. [Understanding XAI and Setting Up Essential Tools](https://datanizant.com/unlocking-ai-transparency-a-practical-guide-to-getting-started-with-explainable-ai-xai/)
2. Creating a Sample Business Use Case
3. Applying LIME for Local Interpretability
4. Exploring SHAP for Global and Local Interpretability
5. Detecting and Mitigating Bias with XAI Tools
6. Concluding Thoughts: The Future of Explainable AI

## Getting Started

1. First, set up the ML/XAI project by following the instructions in `loan_approval_project/README.md`
2. Then, set up the UI application by following the instructions in `loan_approval_ui/README.md`
